        <li>
            He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the internet,
             maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it is simply not
              true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, 
            but math was one area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His 
            involvement is often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he 
            helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter
             to President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which 
             led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated pacifist and, later,
              an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein 
            was convinced that America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.
        </li>
        <li>
            He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work out, 
            Einstein could have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he 
            had the love of music instilled in him—via violin lessons—at the young
             age of five. 
        </li>
        <li>
            He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first
             president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einstein was offered the 
             position, but he declined.
        </li>
        <li>
            He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, 
     Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was, actually,
     quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He had
  affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire    family to Berlin
   without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.   
        </li>
        <li>
            He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t particularly
             surprising. What is surprising is the fact that he didn’t receive it
              for the general or special theory of relativity, but rather
               for the photoelectric effect.
        </li>
        <li>
            He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby.
             But by his own admission, he never made a  particularly good 
             sailor. In fact, he didn’t even know how to swim.
        </li>
        <li>
            He really didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, 
            in a letter to Elsa, 
            he bragged about getting away “without wearing socks” while at Oxford.
        </li>
        <li>
            He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn’t known until the 1980s, 
            but according to correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was 
            determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At one
             point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
        </li>
        <li>
            His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his
             autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually got the 
             permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was fired from
              Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over.
             He kept it for over forty years before finally returning it in 1998.
